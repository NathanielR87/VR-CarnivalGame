# VR-CarnivalGame

Create a VR game where the goal is to knock down bottles into a bucket to score points. You are limited to only 5 balls. The necessary steps to actually get this running on Unity will be in a separate file named "Intro to VR Tutorial 1: Build for iOS." These are the steps I took to get it working on macOS. I would also recommend starting with the GoogleVR setup, as it helps configure Unity for you to begin working. https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart.
